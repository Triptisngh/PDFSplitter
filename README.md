# PDFSplitter
o	The code is written in Java and is designed to split PDF files.
o	The user interface is created using the Swing library, which provides a set of GUI components for Java programs.
o	The GUI consists of a JFrame window, which contains a main JPanel that is used to organize the components.
o	The main JPanel has two sub-panels: a form panel and a button panel.
o	The form panel contains several JLabels and JTextFields that allow the user to enter input file path, output directory path, start page, and end page for the PDF splitting.
o	The button panel contains a single JButton that triggers the PDF splitting process when clicked.
o	The code uses event handling to capture the user input and perform the PDF splitting process.
o	When the splitButton is clicked, the code reads the input file path, output directory path, start page, and end page values from the JTextFields and performs the PDF splitting.
o	The code displays a success message using JOptionPane when the PDF splitting is complete.
